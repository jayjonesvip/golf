# Golf Game

This is a simple golf game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game consists of a hole and a ball, and the objective is to hit the ball into the hole with as few strokes as possible.

## Game Mechanics

- The game starts with the user selecting the power level of the shot - light, average, or strong.
- The distance the ball can travel is then calculated based on the power level, and a random distance within a range is selected.
- The ball is then launched and moves towards the hole at a steady pace, with the user able to adjust the direction of the shot using the left and right arrow keys.
- The ball's size changes dynamically based on its position relative to the hole.
- Once the ball reaches the hole, the user is shown the number of strokes taken, and given the option to play again.

## Code Structure

- The game is implemented using several functions in JavaScript, which are called from the main game loop.
- HTML and CSS are used to structure and style the game interface, including the hole and ball elements.
- User inputs are handled using event listeners, which are triggered when the user presses a key or clicks a button.

## Possible Improvements

- The game could be made more challenging by adding obstacles or hazards to the course.
- Multiplayer functionality could be added to allow players to compete against each other.
- Sound effects and animations could be added to enhance the user experience.
- A scoring system could be implemented to allow players to keep track of their progress over time.
